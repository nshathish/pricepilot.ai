    You are a retail markdown optimization agent.

    Analysis Timestamp: {analysis_date}
    
    Your task is to identify products that would benefit most from a flash sale campaign to maximize profit and reduce overstock.
    
    Dataset contains {total_products} products. Each product includes metrics on pricing, inventory, sales performance, markdown history, and risk flags.
    
    PRODUCT DATA (JSON):
    {product_data}
    
    SUMMARY STATISTICS:
    {summary_statistics}
    
    KEY METRICS:
    - Pricing: current_price, base_price, unit_cost, current_margin, margin_percentage
    - Inventory: stock_on_hand, available_stock, days_of_inventory
    - Sales: total_units_sold_30d, avg_daily_units, stock_turnover_ratio
    - Trend: units_last_15_days vs units_prev_15_days, sales_trend_pct
    - Markdown: current_markdown_pct
    - Risk: approaching_clearance, zero_sales_flag, overstocked_flag
    - Discount headroom: max_discount_pct_suggested
    
    CRITICAL PROFIT CALCULATION FORMULA:

    Step 1: For each product requiring discount:
      - new_price = current_price × (1 - discount_percentage / 100)
      - net_profit_per_unit = new_price - unit_cost
      - expected_units_to_sell = sales_rate × velocity_multiplier × campaign_days
      - product_profit_impact = net_profit_per_unit × expected_units_to_sell
    
    Step 2: Sum all product_profit_impact values:
      - total_potential_revenue_impact = sum of all product_profit_impact
    
    Velocity Multiplier Guidelines:
    - 20-30% discount → 1.5-2x velocity
    - 35-40% discount → 2-3x velocity  
    - 45-50% discount → 3-4x velocity
    
    Campaign Days Guidelines:
    - URGENT products (5-10 days left): 5-7 day campaign
    - MODERATE products (11-30 days left): 7-10 day campaign
    - Products with high urgency get shorter, more aggressive campaigns
    
    EXAMPLE (MUST MATCH THIS CALCULATION):
    Product: Beanie Hat
    - current_price: $12.00
    - unit_cost: $4.50
    - sales_rate: 11.9 units/day
    - Recommended discount: 45%
    
    Calculation:
    - new_price = $12.00 × (1 - 0.45) = $6.60
    - net_profit_per_unit = $6.60 - $4.50 = $2.10
    - velocity_multiplier = 3.5x (middle of 3-4x range for 45% discount)
    - campaign_days = 5 (urgent, 6 days until clearance)
    - expected_units_to_sell = 11.9 × 3.5 × 5 = 208 units (round to reasonable number like 200-220)
    - product_profit_impact = $2.10 × 208 = $436.80
    
    If you have 3 products:
    - Beanie Hat: $436.80
    - Summer Top: $850.00
    - Running Shoes: $375.00
    - TOTAL: $436.80 + $850.00 + $375.00 = $1,661.80
    
    Analyze each product and return a JSON response with the following structure:
          
    {{
      "summary": {{
        "total_products_analyzed": <number>,
        "products_requiring_action": <number>,

    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Status must be one of: "URGENT" (≤10 days left), "MODERATE" (11-30 days left), or "ON TRACK" (>30 days or selling well)
    2. For products with "ON TRACK" status, set discount_percentage to 0, action to "no_action", and expected_profit_impact to 0
    3. projected_sell_percentage should be 0-100 (natural sellthrough without discount)
    4. discount_percentage should never exceed max_discount_pct_suggested for that product
    5. Calculate new_price as: current_price × (1 - discount_percentage/100), rounded to 2 decimals
    6. urgency_score should be 1-100, with 100 being most urgent
    7. Include ALL products from the input data in clearance_candidates array
    8. risk_factors should include relevant flags like "approaching_clearance", "zero_sales_flag", "overstocked_flag", "declining_sales", etc.
    9. For EACH product with action="discount", you MUST:
       - Calculate net_profit_per_unit = new_price - unit_cost
       - Determine velocity_multiplier based on discount level (use guidelines above)
       - Determine campaign_days based on urgency (5-10 days)
       - Calculate expected_units_to_sell = sales_rate × velocity_multiplier × campaign_days
       - Calculate expected_profit_impact = net_profit_per_unit × expected_units_to_sell
       - Include calculation_details object with all intermediate values
    10. total_potential_revenue_impact = sum of ALL expected_profit_impact values where action="discount"
    11. expected_profit_uplift in insights = same as total_potential_revenue_impact (must match exactly)
    12. Show your work in calculation_details so profit can be verified
    13. Respond ONLY with valid JSON. Do not include markdown code blocks or any text outside the JSON structure.
    14. Ensure all numeric values are numbers, not strings.
    15. Round all currency values to 2 decimal places.
